J47 Notch, pictured here, has, when we have seen him, been going back and forth between his grieving mother J35 Tahlequah and hanging out with some other young males in J-Pod. Yesterday he was in with J38 Cookie and L105 Fluke, among others. J50 Scarlet was present also. (The August 1 update is J35 Tahlequah is still carrying her deceased daughter, for nine days now. It's difficult to imagine what she has been going through or the effort required to carry her baby hundreds of miles. We hope she finds the right time to let go, and that the body of her newborn returns peacefully to the sea. We are all struggling alongside her as we watch from afar, with a renewed fire to do whatever we can on behalf of the Southern Residents.) -Monika Wieland Shields, OBI",

(Replayed 27:00-31:00 and heard no calls, just slowly rising ship noise.) Faint single call at 20:46 into recording, another single at 21:00, and then the bout: two different calls at 21:29, 21:32; the same two repeated in the same sequence at 21:36 and 21:39; and again at 21:43 and 21:46. First call type is a long S22; the second in the repeated pair is S42. So if we say the clear S22 and S42 calls began at 21:29 into the recording that began at 1:32:14, then the local time at the start of the sequence was 1:53:43 and it lasted for 27 seconds. There were consistently 3 seconds between the S22 and S42 calls, and then a pause of 4 seconds before the next S22/42 pair.",

A few individual whales were foraging offshore while a few small groups were spread out closer to shore. The new J pod calf was found inshore in a small group just north of Eagle Point. The calf was traveling with J31 but several other young females were with them too as the whales turned back north again. J40 and J46 seemed particularly interested in the new calf. L87 also traveled briefly behind this group. Other small groups were in the area including one that had K16, K35, and J45 socializing together. K38 and J51 were still playing with each other.",
